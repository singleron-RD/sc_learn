## Learning objectives

- Understanding of scRNA-Seq data processing and analysis.
- How to use conda to manage your package environments.
- Basic workflows of Seurat.
- How to use CeleScope.


## Materials
- [scRNA-Seq course](https://scrnaseq-course.cog.sanger.ac.uk/website/index.html#github). This is how I learned scRNA-Seq as a beginner.
- [Conda introduction](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/conda-intro)
- [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/). Seurat is a powerful tool to analysis single-cell data(Not only scRNA-Seq data). 
- [Q&A from 10X genomics](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us). I found them useful and selected some must read Q&A [here](selected_FAQ.md).
- [CeleScope](https://github.com/singleron-RD/CeleScope/blob/master/docs/manual.md). It is our analysis pipeline.
