The questions are in the easy-to-hard order.

- How is sequencing saturation calculated in CellRanger? (5)

- Explain the causes of high level of mitochondrial gene expression in scRNA-Seq data. (10)

- How to modify the STAR alignment parameters in CellRanger? How to modify them in CeleScope? (10)

- 10X V2 chemistry has 10-bp long UMI but 12-bp in V3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of longer UMI? (10)

- Write a script to subset 100 cells with the highest UMI count from pbmc3k data and save the matrix of these 100 cells in 10X format. (15)

- Write a script to calculate the sequencing saturation of the CeleScope rna test data(https://github.com/singleron-RD/celescope_test_script/tree/master/rna). (15)
